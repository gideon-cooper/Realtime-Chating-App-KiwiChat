Create a realtime chat app that allows users to choose and join a room and chat with other people.

What i will use:

- React
- Socket.io (Library for realtime communication between users)
- Node js / Express
- Possible a css framework like Boostrap?

Aim:

- Create application that allows a user to choose and join a room to chat with another person
- Multiple rooms that users can join

Stretch goals:

- Allow multiple users.
- ~~Make customised warning pop up if nothing has been typed in the initial input boxes~~ COMPLETED (Instead of a warning i decided to disable the button until the user has put in some information)
- Share files in the chat eg Videos, images
- Emoji functionality
